## To-do list for daily tasks

This project is a node application where you can add items to a list of todo's. It looks like it saves to the local storage because when I refresh the page the todos are still there. When the user clicks the todo, then it crosses the item out, indicating that the item is complete.

### Get started

1. Fork the project

2. Clone it

3. Create a branch if you want to resolve any issue or else

4. Run npm install 
(The NPM - Node Package Manager is the default package manager for NodeJs.)
(NPM allows open-source web developers to share and borrow packages for app development)

5. open index.html
